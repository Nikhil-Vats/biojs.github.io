BioJS is a community-based project compiling JavaScript widgets and modular components to visualize and process biological data using web technologies, making it easier to integrate them to your own website. BioJS provides a registry showcase so users can search components and see them in action.

BioJS started in 2012 and has grown via _Google Summer of Code (GSoC)_ where BioJS has participated standalone in 2014 and 2016, and as part of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation in 2018. In 2015, BioJS and the Galaxy project joined forces and created a tool to automatically convert BioJS components into Galaxyâ€™s visualisation system.
