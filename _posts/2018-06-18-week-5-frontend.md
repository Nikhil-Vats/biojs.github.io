## Recap
Week 4 consisted of adding great details to the component's page. A sample page for cytoscape can be seen [here](http://139.59.93.32/biojs-frontend/dist/#/component/cytoscape). Tests were written and documentation was updated.

## This week's progress
A search component was implemented to search amongst all the components. It searched across the component's name and it's tags. More information regarding the search can be found [here](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-frontend/pull/11) (details about the fuzzy search here). Documentation was also updated.

## Tasks completed in week 5
  1. Implemented fuzzy search and integrated it with backend. [Visit](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-frontend/pull/11).
  2. Linked the components to their individual pages. [Visit](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-frontend/pull/13).
  3. Documentation has been updated. [Visit](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-frontend/pull/14)
The changes and the discussion can be seen here in the [pull requests](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-frontend/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
