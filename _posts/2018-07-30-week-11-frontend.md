## Recap
An important decision to first test the visualizations on our website and compare it with the old biojs.io website and analyse what we have to do further was made in week 10.

## This week's progress
I majorly worked on adding test elements to the website for ease in week 10. Few other changes to refine the website like npm URL of the component, link to the contributor's profile, etc. were made.

## Tasks completed in week 11
  1. Link to random components having visualizations added on the website.
  2. Created a user-friendly “Contact Us” page.
  3. Connected visualizations with workmen.
  4. Search tag upon clicking one implemented.

## Minutes of the meeting (weekly call on Sunday):
  1. Dennis opened up a few issues in the biojs-frontend repository. Fix them.
  2. Have a get query 'debug' in the URLs where if it is present and set to 'true', the random-generator for components is present else it should not be present.
  3. Create a prioritization report for fixing the visualization issues.
  4. Add anything that has to be done as an issue so it can be tackled in the future, in case Megh or Sarthak are not able to work in the future.

## Goals for week 12
  1. Fix issues in biojs-frontend repository tagged as GSoC 2018.
  2. Have a get query 'debug' in the URLs where if it is present and set to 'true', the random-generator for components is present else it should not be present.
  3. Create a prioritization report for fixing the visualization issues.
