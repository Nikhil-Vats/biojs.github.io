## Recap
Week 8 majorly consisted of finishing up the documentation. Major details like the API requests and responses were added to the documentation.
## This week's progress
Week 9 consisted of working up on the visualizations and finding and fixing the errors in particular visualizations.

## Tasks completed in week 9
  1. Documentation updated
  2. Work done on visualizations

## Minutes of the meeting (weekly call on Sunday):
  1. Lay out a high level model for testing the visualizations. A decent approach will be to list all the components having visualizations of the website, there visualizations and links to the visualization in the old website and the new website for a comparison.
  2. We need to get reviews from the BioJS community on the UI of the new website. The link to the new website will hence be added to the BioJS blog.
  3. The UI of the search results in the components' page needs to be improved.

## Goals for week 10
  1. Integrate visualizations
  2. Write unit tests

## Website
The latest version of the website can be found [here](http://139.59.93.32/biojs-frontend/dist/#/).
